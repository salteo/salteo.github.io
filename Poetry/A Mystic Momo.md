##  A Mystic Momo

*I woke up this morning tired and bleak,<br>
on the compact disk i tried to seek,<br>
my favorite song for days like these,<br>
Chet Morton's hit "Puffy Eyed Geese"*<br>

*I slid the disc into its holder,<br>
pressed play, the music made me bolder,<br> 
I ventured into the bathroom cold,<br> 
amidst the notes of pain painted gold.*<br> 

*I stepped out quick all scrubbed and clean,<br> 
but my eyes still red; last night's dream,<br> 
had kept me tossing all night long,<br>
seeking the words to an unfamiliar song.*<br>

*I heard it someday a long time ago,<br> 
when whispers in my ear had made me glow,<br> 
even smiles from her would make me cry,<br> 
because all her antics, were to make me sigh.* 

*And then the rooster cried, I awoke,<br>
petrified, terrified, a dishevelled bloke,<br>
I thought I was awake, where was I then,<br>
awake in a dream, transcending zen.*<br>

*So I woke up again, tired and bleak,<br>
the disk stood ready, I started to seek,<br>
the air waves resounded with "Puffy Eyed Geese"<br>
as I spread on my bread, pepper and cheese.*<br>
