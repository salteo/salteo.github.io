##  The Trek


*Nothing matters anymore,<br>
in this cold, cold whirling globe,<br>
everything is vanity,<br>
a tragedy yet to unfold*

*I seek to forget,<br>
and strive to go blind,<br>
imagining endless years ahead,<br>
full of this slow grind.*

*Life with its gilt-edged gift-boxes,<br>
with, oh! nothing worthwhile inside,<br>
but birthing strange delusions,<br>
to satisfy man's vain pride*

*Why is this madness?<br>
why do we idiots cling,<br>
to this incredible emptiness,<br>
to these worthless things?*

*I know not, I seek not,<br>
any great understanding,<br>
I just trek on in deep silence<br>
to the door that will reveal,<br>
everything.*

> *Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.<br> \- The Book of Ecclesiastes, Chapter 12, Verse 4.*
