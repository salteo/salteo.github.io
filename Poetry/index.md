## Poetry 

Below are some poems I wrote many years ago or recently

| [**Fear Unbottled**](/Poetry/Fear Unbottled): *even as the peace we once knew fast disappears* | 
| [**The Trek**](/Poetry/The Trek): *when everything is just simply vanity* | 
| [**A Mystic Momo**](/Poetry/A Mystic Momo): *just a silly mind-bender* |
