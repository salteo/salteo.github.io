# The Harmonics of 'Nostress'

There was a man named Steve who one day heard of a wonderful plant, with the Latin name *Nostress*. The man who told him about it, said that the rare-to-find plant had been known to have powerful medicinal properties that could heal all kinds of diseases relating to the soul.

Steve was an ailing man with a broken heart. He decided to take a few days off to travel and ask around as much as possible about this wonderful plant. Soon he learned more. 

Apparently, after one found the plant, one had to grind it to pulp along with some green peas, and drink it down drop-by-drop, one drop at a time. Each drop would be bittersweet, and the next drop had to be taken as soon as the taste of the previous drop subsided, either after a few days or sometimes after a few hours. If perchance the *Nostress* taker allowed his mind to wander and too much time elapsed after the bittersweet taste had waned, much of its medical efficacy would be reduced. It would still work but it wouldn't be as effective. In short, the medicine worked only inasmuch as the taker remained aware of its lingering taste; as soon as one lost one's awareness of *Nostress*, more of *Nostress* would have to be taken, or it would result in a medical condition called *distress*. 

Steve wondered how he would find enough of these rare-to-find plants to maintain such an unusual medical regimen. But those who gave him all this information said that even one leaf of the plant, ground with a few green peas could be diluted with water to make a potentially unlimited supply of the remedy. All that was needed was only a drop at a time. And if done right, the taste of each drop would actually last for quite a long time.

Steve believing all that he had heard, set off on the great quest to find the plant that could cure his broken heart. One day, after a lot of travelling and a lot of searching, he finally found the plant and soon his heart and soul were mended. He had traveled far and wide and paid a high cost for the find. But he was happy. Soon, thinking about others who would also benefit from the plant's healing properties, he shared some of the green translucent drops with people who had broken hearts, distressed minds, and oscillations of the temporal lobe. *Nostress* worked amazingly on almost all these conditions, and Steve was even more happy.

However, many days later, Steve began doing the accounts for his travels. The more he thought of the costs he had paid, and the business opportunities he had foregone during his travels, the more his soul chafed. He started drinking more of the green drops but because his awareness was increasingly prone to wandering back to monetary price he had paid, he was increasingly distressed. One day in frustration at how the medicine was not working, he gulped down an entire bottle of the *Nostress* preparation, forgetting how the druids who had given him the plant had clearly warned him that it was to be taken in only one drop at a time.

Steve was now under the tremendous vice-like grip of that dreaded condition distress. He plucked another leaf from the plant so as to grind it, but as soon as he touched it, it turned black in color and soon resembled the leaf of the plant of *Distress*. He plucked all the leaves one by one, but all of them were distressed. He did not know what to do. He closed down his business, said good-bye to his friends, and once more set out in search of a new bud of the plant of *Nostress*.
