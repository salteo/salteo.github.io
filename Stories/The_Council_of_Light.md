## The Council of Light

"What is the truth?" Phil asked sternly. He waited for an answer, his hands crossed behind his back, as he paced up and down the large corner office.

John stood silently with his head lowered, not because he did not know the answer, but because he knew Phil did not really want to hear the truth. 

Phil knew the truth or at least had an inkling; John couldn't have done something so stupid. He was definitely being made a scapegoat, once again. 

Ever since he had been hired, Phil had heard enough stories to know that trouble followed John wherever he went. On investigating quietly through his back channels, Phil discovered that every single time, this guy John was the one who was being made a scape goat. Phil did not bother to intervene. Office politics could be brutal and scapegoats were always needed. But he wondered how a guy so brilliant could always manage to end up being the fall guy. 

But now John stood there in front of him seemingly nonchalant. The alleged mistake was no longer minor, but had costed the company hundreds of thousands in wasted revenue. Phil could almost smell the fear in the room. He exulted in his authority, and in the fact that he had the power to sack John without any explanations. Sure, there would be questions, but these could be handled. He knew if he fired John, word would spread in the niche industry they operated in, and no other company would touch him with a barge pole. Phil could almost read these thoughts spinning around like a tornado inside John's mind. 

And yet, irritatingly, John did not speak. "Why do you always want to be the martyr?", Phil almost screamed now, "Don't you know that I can sack you for this?" "Why won't you at least try to defend yourself?"

John raised his head and looked at Phil. For almost five minutes there was an uncanny stillness as Phil stared at him, and then John bent his head forward again, deep in thought. In those five minutes, Phil realized he really had to sack the man. Because that was when he saw that John wasn't really afraid. Everything he had assumed about John was false. Everything he had imagined whirling about in John's head was a reflection of his own fears. John's eyes, when he opened up the windows to his soul, were filled with blue skies and clouds floating on calm breezes. He really did not care. 

Phil could not bear that brazen nonchalance which reduced his puffed up authority to absolute nothingness. As John walked out of the door, Phil unnecessarily shouted out once more so that those waiting outside the door could also hear, "You're fired, scumbag. This was the last straw!" John once again gave him a genuinely honest smile as he turned around and said, "Thank you, Sir."

And with that John Galt walked out of Sphel Pharma and into the void of temporary nothingness. He planted seeds in the desert, and kept an eye out for rain. Soon winds carried him along and brought him to a plain. From the plain he saw mountains, and then some valleys too. He climbed the mountains and descended into the valleys. He saw streams and deep dark pools. Then, he explored peculiar mysteries in the deep dense overgrowth of the forests. The birds sang to him, and squirrels shared their nuts with him. He grew to like the taste of freshly killed earthworms.

Many years later as he watched, from within the eye of a bee that he was travelling in, he saw psychedelic colors in whirling patterns. He had traversed to the edge of the great river, and finally and exhaustively understood the meaning of life. All the dots connected instantly, and what was slowly becoming clear to him over all those wandering years, instantly and magically snapped into focus. He was inexpressibly happy as he looked back over his wanderings, and drank in even more of the meaning of everything that now flooded his soul to the brim. 

And then there was only one thing left to do. The time had finally arrived. He stepped into the icy waters of the great river and felt cold. Then, through his eyes which by now were opaque marbles, he saw the council of light that he had only heard and read about for so long, in the life of the desert, in the songs of the streams, and in the whisperings of the forest. As the council rose to welcome him, everything around him, the animals, the birds, and the breeze itself hushed, and an eerie, yet happy, chill fell over him. In spite of his many-hued journeys through time, he could scarcely take in this level of beauty. 

Unimaginable bliss filled him, as the swells of inexpressibly enchanting music rose and fell like the breast of a humming bird. As the waters rose above his fast disappearing gray head, the last words he spoke were, "Thank you, Sir."
