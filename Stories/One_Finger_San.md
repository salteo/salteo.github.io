## One Finger San

San Kale Wadi sat silently unmoving in a lotus pose. Two of his oldest disciples Chok Dange and Chok Mankar, also in the lotus pose, sat together watching the San *(which means Master in the Wulla lingo)* in his meditation. They soon tired of watching his even breathing and expression of absolute calm and looked surreptitiously at the other Choks *(Chok means disciple in the Wulla lingo)* who also appeared to be pretending to meditate.

*“San!”*, Chok Dange suddenly blurted out loudly.

He did not like to disturb the San, but the long silences the master was increasing treating the Choks to was getting too heavy for him. And what he had to say couldn’t wait. During the times of scheduled meditation, the San had not expressly bidden the Choks to be silent. But as the long days of the discipleship program slowly dissolved into months, the Choks found themselves imitating the revered San, almost unconsciously.

The San opened one-third of one eye to identify the origin of the disturbance which sounded almost like a plaintive cry. He knew that the silence that he imposed on the Choks by the power of his iron will, would bring out the residues of the subliminal thought streams that he had not yet managed to erase from the Chok’s lives.

*“Speak my son,”* he gently invited.

*“San!*’, Dange spoke haltingly trying to control his out-of-control emotions, *”Chok Mankar just pulled my gown. Over the past few days his mischief has been increasing, and now he has even managed to disturb the sanctity of the silence hour.”*

*“Chok Dange, you are not right. He disturbed you but it is you who disturbed the silence this morning.”*
  
Dange shamefacedly lowered his head, and looked sideways at the barely noticeable sly grin that Mankar was trying hard to prevent from appearing on his face. He wondered why the San was always partial to Mankar. He was sure even a fool with half a brain would figure out that it was Mankar who was constantly provoking him. Of course the San was no fool. But could the perfect San have the imperfection of partiality? Why in God’s name did he not reprimand Mankar even once?

The months passed, and with them the years. Mankar once put a dead lizard in Dange’s food plate, one day into his vow of pure speech resolve. As they grew older together, and the months of the discipleship melted into years, Markar’s tricks became less obvious and more cunning. He seemed hell bent on putting Dange in a frying pan of smouldering emotions.

And then the years melted away into decades, and eventually all the Choks forgot how many ages had passed, and time lost much of it’s meaning for them. 

One day, the now gray haired Chok Dange was lost listening to the San speak about the twelth level of consciousness in the great discourse hall. He was brought back to earth by the pain of a hammer shattering his small finger. But by now, having already lost three of his fingers over the years to similar blows from Chok Mankar, his whimper of pain was almost inaudible. Over the years, he had learned to ignore much of the pain, even as Mankar had learned how to show just a bare trace of that sly grin on his face.

But as the reverberations of that controlled whimper spiralled and rebounded along the oblong walls of discourse hall, they could be heard by all. The San who had ascended to the thirteenth level of consciousness heard the music of that whimper and approved. The pitch was just right. The reverberations had shattered Mankar’s soul and his dead body soundlessly fell facedown.

San Kale Wadi stood up and threw the written code of the ancient Sans, which he had always held in his right hand, to Dange. Chok Dange expertly caught it with the last remaining finger on his right hand. Over the decades that had passed in his struggles with Mankar, he had become increasingly dexterous with his reducing number of fingers and toes so much so that he had far surpassed the abilities of all the other fuller fingered Choks.

As they buried old San Kale Wadi and Chok Mankar that evening, amidst the hymns and the chanting, the batch of fresh new Choks were all abuzz with how they had never realized that the former San also had only one finger. Just like the new San. San Dange.
