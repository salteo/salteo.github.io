##  A Drive to Jakkalamadagu Dam

I had unusually woken up from sleep before dawn, but had nothing on my schedule for the day. Not wanting to spend an entire day doing nothing, I decided on the spur of the moment to drive to Chikkaballapur, a small city on the outskirts of Bangalore. A few years ago, an acquaintance who had grown up there had told me the place was enjoyably rustic, and that thought had been in my mind for long.

After a quick shower, I immediately set out to escape the notorious rush hour traffic for which Bangalore is best-known, and which is slowly regaining the vigor it had before the pandemic. The early morning traffic was light and making good speed, I reached the broad highway which leads to the international airport located at one extremity of the city. After a good breakfast of Neer dosa and tea at an Udipi restaurant beside the highway - I drove on to Chikkaballapur which was only another half-hour away.

When I reached Chikkaballapur however, I found it was not rustic at all. Like any other small, non-descript Indian city, it had clustered shops and buildings, honking traffic, morning crowds of school-goers and shoppers, and a claustrophobic feel. Disappointed, I walked around aimlessly when I espied an Internet cafe on the main road. Since I have been attempting to practise digital minimalism, I had deleted the browser app on my phone, and so the serendepitous cafe came as a God send. 

I logged in and searched for nearby places of interest, and decided to visit the nearest one - Jakkalamagadu dam, to avoid making the trip a complete waste. From what I read, this  dam provides drinking water to all of Chikkaballapur, which I discovered is not just a city, but the name of the encompassing district as well.

Following google maps instructions, I set out from the center of the city and onto Highway 69 which leads to the dam. And that's when I realised that the rustic charm my acquaintance had referred to was of the district and not the city. Just like the roads to Nandi hills, which is a tourist destination nearby, both sides of the curving road I was driving on were soon flanked by lush green fields that had drunk deeply of the monsoons, plantations sprinkled with flower patches, leafy vineyards, and hills that were speckled with large boulders.

So starved had I been of any greenery whatsoever for the past few months, that I drove along drinking deeply of the beautiful landscape and soon found myself lost in the village roads. Eventually I came to spot where I could see the lake shimmering in the distance, but the coordinates of the lake in Google maps were incorrect, and I was heading to a point in the middle of nowhere. And yet it was soothing to be in the middle of nowhere and I stopped at multiple places to just be one with the scenery.

While the clouds had hung dark and heavy in the morning when I started the trip, I noticed now that most of them had silently travelled further to discharge their watery burdens on other places. So with the sun uncloaked and the temperature rising, I curtailed my desire to keep driving around aimlessly and deeply inhaling the fresh village air. I asked a passing small-truck driver for directions, who thankfully understanding Hindi, gave me good directions to the obscure road that led to the dam. 

This road was blocked by a rope stretched across it, and an old man manning the rope barrier charged me Rs.30/ to pass. But because he gave me an official looking receipt in return, I'm unsure whether he was just a guy making a quick buck or an actual employee of the village panchayat. Passing on, I soon found the dam in front of me. It wasn't as large as I expected, but thankfully there were not too many people around as well.

Nearby, there were a couple of small stalls selling snacks, a large Hindu temple, and a path which led up to the lake. Walking up, there were a couple of jetties which extended into the lake, and I sat there for a while just sitting and admiring the clean lake which is unusual for something so close to a city.

All the dark clouds by now had followed the example of their earlier-disappearing colleagues, and it being noon by now, the sun was burning down brightly on my bald pate which could find no shady shelter for its plight. I had for a brief while lost myself in the enchantment of the place, but my burning skull reminded me that it was now time to get back.

In any case, there wasn't much else to do, and so I fired up the car and headed back home. After a lesiurely drive, once agin enjoying the scenic beauty of the landscape, and the curving valley roads, I reached the chaos of Chikkaballapur city. Driving through it, and back onto the airport road,  had lunch at a roadside eatery and then came to the toll booths barricading the entrance back to the city. And that's where I realized my digital fastag had no balance in it and I was stuck. This is where my digital minimalism again came back to haunt me and I had to park the vhicle on the side of the road as I rushed around trying to figure out how to pay the toll charges using cash. That work finally done, I crossed the toll barriers and soon plunged myself back into the rude familiarity of peak hour traffic in the big city. 

A hour and a half later of being numbed by the honking, the pollution, and messy traffic jams, I finally reached home and reviewed the day's learnings. The first, perhaps I've taken the fad of digital minimalism too far and should perhaps cut it a little slack. If it wasn't for that internet cafe, this would have been a completely wasted day. Also, i had to spend extra money and time, just because I did not have a banking app on my phone which would have allowed me to easily recharge my fastag to cross the tollbooth. Second, I should have carried a cap along. 

In conclusion and looking back, would I recommend Jakkalamadagu Dam to anyone for an outing? Well, its worth a drive in the monsoons when the fields are verdant with promise, and only if you you're not someone who needs much stimulation. All it can offer you is a brief get-away and some peace and quiet not too far away from the city.
