##  Strength and Beauty


> *"strength and beauty are in his sanctuary" <br>\- The Book of Psalms, Chapter 96, Verse 6b*

When we run for refuge to the Lord's sanctuary, we find both strength and beauty. And nowhere else, do we find both to such an exorbitant degree. For in the Lord's sanctuary, we come face to face with God Himself, and we come face to face with strength and beauty.

For He is not only the fierce God who swept away an entire Egyptian army in a raging flood, He is also the God who took little children onto His lap. He is not only the God who created the mighty mountains, He is also the God who created the delicate lily. He is not only the God who with a strong arm redeems His people from the deep dark dungeons of sin, ignorance, and indifference, He is also the gentle God who with beautiful words consoles them in the dark of the night. 

How strong is the Lord and how great His power! How beautiful is the Lord in all His works!
