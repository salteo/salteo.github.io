# When Water Became Wine

The Gospel of John in the New Testament has a fascinating account of the first miracle the Lord Jesus ever did. Here it is as the ESV translation from the original Greek puts it:

>*On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out,the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”*

>*Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.” This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.*

This passage reveals the wonderful miracle that the Lord Jesus did. But what is even more wonderful is that He continues to perform miracles even today. Just as He turned what could have been an occassion of shame and loss of face for the host of that wedding party by turning the lack of wine into a surplus of wine, and good one at that, today He is transforming the lack of joy and merriment in many a lives into an abundance of enjoyment.

Today, many a soul makes arrangements for a merry life. But like with the jars at the wedding in Cana, sooner or later the wine runs out and the party grinds to a halt. Perhaps, the lack of merriment could be due to a bereavement, a loss of health, or loss or wealth, or a myriad other causes due to living in an imperfect, sin-stricken world. Whatever the cause, the guests begin to feel the lack, eventually leave, and then one is left to mope alone.

But when empty souls turn to the Saviour, He offers them the gift of His Holy Spirit and transforms the emptiness in their lives into good and pleasant fullness. This great miracle first started on the day of Pentecost in the city of Jerusalem when the Apostle Peter preached the clarion call of the gospel after the Lord's resurrection:

>*Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.* 

On that day, thousands of the people who listened believed in his message and were first filled with the Holy Spirit. The watching crowd were amazed and perplexed seeing the inexplicable changes in them, and some of them said mockingly because they did not understand: 

>*They are filled with new wine*

But the miracle has continued to this day. Millions across the globe and across the sands of time have repented of their sins, and have experienced the miracle of the water of their emptiness being turned into wine. And that transformation from a state of emptiness to a state of fullness, from a vessel of simple water to a vessel of good wine, is true for scores of people even now. All this is only because they have received the free gift of the Holy Spirit.

The gift of the Holy Spirit is absolutely free, and none can ever even hope to pay for it. But the gift is conditional, it requires an acceptance. Like the Apostle Peter preached, that acceptance means an acknowledgement of one's sins, and repentance - in other words, a turning away from those sins. 

Oh empty reader, do you struggle with the emptiness in your life? Would you listen to Peter and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit today? If you do, this will only be the first of many miracles that the Lord will perform in your life. As King David said of the Lord in the Book of Psalms: 

>*In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.*
