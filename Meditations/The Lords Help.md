## The Lord's Help

>*Who rises up for me against the wicked? <br>
>Who stands up for me against the evildoers?* <br>        \- Psalms 94:16

The world today, just as it was during the Psalmist’s times, was wicked and evil. And just as today one feels helpless looking all around at all that is going on, the Psalmist looked for help. We look around for help too, hoping that perhaps some politician will come by who will not be corrupt, or perhaps some scientist will discover solutions to the world’s problems, but the more we look the more we are disappointed. Wickedness only increases and evil only runs all the more rampant.

The Psalmist realised this and He looked to the Lord for help and having received it could say in the next verse: 

>*If the Lord had not been my help, <br>
>My soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.* <br>
>\- Psalms 94:17

But what is the help that the Lord provided? In the Psalmist’s time, the Lord was in the business of intervening and providing help in the material circumstances of the Israelites. He fought their battles, provided supernaturally, and dispensed divine counsel when needed through His prophets. 

Today, in this age of grace, the Lord continues to provide help to the people who look to Him for help. Yet, more than just the physical help we need and do receive, we recognize now that the even greater and more valuable help we receive is primarily spiritual.  Paul, a chosen messenger  of The Lord,  said in the book of Ephesians (6:12) 
>*"we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”* 

Through the lens of God’s word to us, the evil in the world today  — as it always as been — is revealed to have cosmic roots and significance. Because these cosmic forces are both extremely evil and extremely powerful, and because of the sinful nature which humanity has because of the original sin, no man is able by his own efforts to resist their temptations and their evil. And thus all humanity forfeits that standard of moral perfection which is required for an entrance into eternal life after death. 

So, while the Psalmist was grateful to the Lord for providing help from physical death that his enemies threatened him with, today we recognize that the help the Lord has provided us is to escape from the second death that the forces of evil want to drag us to. This is a death that translates into an eternal separation from God and all that is good. This is a death that translates not only residence in an abode of silence in the depths of the earth until the day of judgement, but after that into a life spent in the torment of eternal and everlasting hellfire.  

Have you experienced the Lord’s help? Have you sought it? You may have not for perhaps you have never heard before that He is able to provide it. But He is. His love for our souls caused Him to descend down from his heavenly abode to this here earth and lay down his life as a sacrifice for us all. Because His life was perfect and holy, his death served as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of the Almighty God against our sin, wickedness, and evil. The world is now presented with a free pass to heaven, if only we would accept it. And for those who have accepted it, this is the help we recognize as being of the most valuable kind that the Lord provides. For physical help has value for the moment  — for this life at most  — but spiritual help will last for an eternity.

This is why we can say with the Psalmist:

>*If the Lord had not been my help, <br>
>My soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.*<br>
>\- Psalms 94:17

How great is the Lord’s help, for without it all men’s souls would soon dwell in the abode of silence!
