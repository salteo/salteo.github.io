# Honor your Boss

>All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against. 
- 1 Timothy 6:1

Through this verse, Paul reminds Timothy to teach an important principle. Believers are to regard their masters as worthy of all honour. While the people of this world oftentimes honour their masters, they may do so only as lip service and with an intent to flatter, or curry favour.

This verse reminds us that we are not only called to honour our earthly masters but to go a step further and regard them as worthy of honour. Regard of a person is contained within the heart and can only be judged by God. May we as children of God, recognise the sovereignty of God and His power in placing over His children the authority He deems fit. And then may we understanding the principle behind this verse go on to regard these authorities as worthy of all honour.

Our bosses may be evil, they may be stupid, they may be lazy, or they may have an unending list of bad qualities, but let us regard them as worthy of all honor, for the simple reason that if we do not do so Jesus Christ, the name of God, and the Christian doctrine will be spoke against, and the kingdom of God will suffer damage. Let us not join in with our colleagues who speak well of the boss when he is around, and gossip and back bite when he isn't. May we depend on the Lord, to grow in applying this command.
