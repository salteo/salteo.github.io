## In the Quest of Wisdom

In the book of Job, one of Job's friends asks him two interesting questions, that are worth pondering over:

>*"Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?<br>
Should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good?"<br>- Job chapter 15:2*

Today, the world is filled with knowledge. Unlike the vast ancient libraries of Alexandria in Egypt which were limited by their physicality, the scope of the libraries on the internet is seemingly unlimited. Perhaps only God knows the extent of knowledge it contains. 

Yet most of it is windy knowledge. Like with the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the beautiful garden of Eden, we are tempted to dip our toes into this flood of information, for it promises to make us wise. But will it?

The question of wisdom and where it can be found is an important one and one that many have considered. Like Job, who later on in his book cries out:

>*"But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?"<br>- The Book of Job, Chapter 28, verse 12*

I for one, believe that yes, while the Internet bursts at its seams with knowledge, there is very little wisdom to be gained from it. While wisdom can tie together the various facets of knowledge and lead to understanding, knowledge by itself is sadly bereft of wisdom. I agree with Job when he says in the next few verses:

>*"Man does not know its worth,<br>
and it is not found in the land of the living.<br>
The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’<br>
and the sea says, ‘It is not with me."<br>- The Book of Job, Chapter 28, verse 13,14*

Where then can wisdom be found, I ask and so does Job again:

>*“From where, then, does wisdom come?<br>
And where is the place of understanding?<br>- The Book of Job, Chapter 28, verse 20*

Thankfully, this great ancient man gives us a clue as he goes on to say:

>*"It is hidden from the eyes of all living
and concealed from the birds of the air.<br>
Abaddon and Death say,<br>
‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’<br>
“God understands the way to it,<br>
and he knows its place.<br>
For he looks to the ends of the earth<br>
and sees everything under the heavens.<br>- The Book of Job, Chapter 28, verse 21-24*

And then by the end of the chapter, there it is, the answer, as clear as day:

>*And he said to man,<br>
‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,<br>
and to turn away from evil is understanding.’” <br>- The Book of Job, Chapter 28, verse 28*

This the same conclusion, the wisest king known to the ancient world, King Solomon reached by the end of his well-known book, The Ecclesiastes:

>*The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd. My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh. The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.<br>- The Book of Ecclesiastes, Chapter 12, verses 11-13*

Returning to the two questions that Job's friend posed to him: 

>*should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? <br>
should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good?,* 

When I ponder these questions, I realize I have once again fallen into the trap of the devil. I have filled my mind with the wisdom of the world. With its podcasts, news articles, geopolitical and economic analysis, and current events. I have begun consuming the words of men and filling my belly with the 'east wind.' I have neglected the word of the Lord to become 'wise.' But like many others who have pursued this path, I have instead become a fool. I realize now that this 'wisdom' leads to unprofitable talk. These are words with which I can do no good.

May the Lord help me to return to a rrespect for His Word, the collected sayings of that one Shepherd, which alone will teach me to fear Him, and in which there is much wisdom.
