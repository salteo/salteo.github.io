## Encourage Someone Today

>Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
- The Letter to the Hebrews 3:12,13

What day is it today? **Today**!

So then we have two things to do:
1. Examine our hearts for evil and unbelief. No matter who we are, we have to take care because our hearts are prone to falling away from the living God. We have to take care because often this happens without even our knowing it.
2. Encourage one another. We are our brother's keepers. This is a command, and if each of us does not do this, many of us will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

What will you do, **Today**?
