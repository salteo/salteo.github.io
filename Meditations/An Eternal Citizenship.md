# An Eternal Citizenship

>*"For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;..."*<br> *- The Book of Philippians, Chapter 3, verse 20.*

Its always been the case. Many have always sought to obtain citizenship in nations fairer than theirs, seeking to escape the overwhelming poverty, brutality, persecution, corruption, or crime in the countries into which they were born. They often exert strenuous effort and expend immense sums of money in fleeing the ills they know in ther homelands and stretch forward in faith to take hold of what they hope will be a better life. 

It is only natural to seek a better quality of life by seeking an entirely new citizenship. But soon the ills of the new country begin to reveal itself. No matter how advanced a nation, it is beset by the curse of corruption and decay to which God has subjected the whole world to. The corruption may manifest in a different nature across the nations of the world, but the tried and tested truth is that no earthly citizenship can completely satisfy the human instinct for the ideal. For man created in the very image of a perfect God will always be troubled by the imperfections around him. 

But the believing Christian, knowing these things to be true through the work of the Spirit of God who knows all, seeks not the futile quest of an earthly ideal but the manifestation of his heavenly citizenship. He believes that his citizenship of the eternal kingdom is priceless because all its denizens are free, truly free, and eternally free from the ills that beset the nations of this world. He knows that in that heavenly country, the King is a servant and also God. There the laws of the land are radically different, because the focus of all its citizens is on the King and each other and not on self. There he believes, there will be complete unity and complete harmony. 

The Christian also knows that the citizenship of this ideal kingdom is not too expensive for him. He only needed to accept that great invitation of the God-King who Himself paid a terribly-high price for his acceptance into the kingdom. And so, it has cost him nothing but a beneficial turning away from the sinful, destructive ways of the countries below and a sincere belief in the freely offered gift of entry.  And until his already processed travel papers reach him, he spends his days longing to be in that land of delight where the only law is love and its burden is light, and where the King Himself manifestly epitomizes that law of love. 
 
And so the verse is true. Though not there yet, the Christian has already reached there in faith. And though he eagerly awaits, he awaits from there. What a beautiful, paradoxical mystery!
