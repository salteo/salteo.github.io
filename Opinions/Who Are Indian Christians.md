## Who are the Indian ‘Christians’


According to the last conducted Indian census in 2011, 2.4% of the population were ‘Christian’ which translates to over 1.8 crore people (18512051 to be precise).

However, last year, Pew research¹ after a large scale survey reported some interesting findings about Indian ‘Christians’:

* Conversion is rare, overall, just 2% of respondents report a different religion than the one in which they were raised
* Nearly all Indian ‘Christians’ (98%) say they believe in God; that means 2% of Indian ‘Christians’ do not believe in God
* Most Indian ‘Christians’ say they believe in karma (54%), which is not rooted in the Christian religion. And many Indian ‘Christians’ also believe in reincarnation (29%) and that the Ganges River has the power to purify (32%), both of which are core teachings in Hinduism.

These findings are interesting because they cause one to question who is a Christian anyways. Can Christianity be defined like most other religions by the faith of the family one is born into or that of the parent one is born to?

> *And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.* <br>— The Book of Acts 11:26, The Holy Bible

The first mention of Christians is in the verse above. And clearly it is the disciples who were called Christians. The word disciples indicate a group of people following the teachings of the Christ. Today, the proper continued use of the term Christian can only include those who acknowledge themselves as followers of Christ, His teachings, and those of His handpicked apostles all preserved in the Holy Scriptures.

So where does that leave Indian ‘Christians’? If they are painfully unaware of the essential teachings, they are perhaps ‘Christians’ only in name and not in reality.
