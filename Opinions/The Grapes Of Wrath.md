## The Fast-ripening Grapes of Wrath

Recently I read John Steinbeck's classic novel on the plight of American farmers during the great depression. *The Grapes of Wrath* inspired by reality, paints a horrific, bleak picture of those dark years. 

When depression era farmers hit by rising costs could not pay back their debts, either the banks or the very wealthy took over their farmlands. However, with no love for the land or inherent knowledge of the soil, these capitalists developed mercenary tendencies wanting somehow to recover their investments in the land. Eventually they ended up destroying much of the food supply, keeping it from the starving, landless farmers, in a bid to keep prices high and reap windfall profits.

### History repeats itself

But it does seem that perhaps the novel could be read as prophetic too, for like history repeating itself,  the depression-era dynamics that threw the hardworking American farmers out of their farms and into degrading servitude and horrible living conditions, seem to have arrived once again. And once again, these conditions are manifesting, not just in America but across the globe.

Fears of an economic recession are looming in the US, and resultantly across the world with many countries beginning to experience rampant inflation. At the same time, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is driving food prices to defy gravity. That’s because Ukraine combined with Russia, accounted for about 30 percent of global wheat exports and 20 percent of corn exports in the last three years. 

Also, over recent years, the wealthy have amassed unbelievable amounts of land. For instance, last year, the New York Post reported Bill Gates as the largest farmland owner in the US with 242,000 acres of farmland and nearly 27,000 acres of other land across 19 states. The publication quoted the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as saying it aims to “support country-led inclusive agricultural transformation across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.” And its not just wealthy capitalists, the US's most powerful foe, China is also buying billions worth of farmland.

And then Fox News reports on the strangeness of food processing plants catching fire across America. Whether, these are conspiracy theories or not, the fact remains that food prices are starting to hurt not just in America, but globally. And in the midst of all this, wacky policies built on fears of  climate change are forcing farmers to protest across Europe - in the Netherlands, in Germany, Spain, Poland, and perhaps many more countries eventually.  Will the Sri Lankan crisis, where primarily an ill-advised fertilised ban caused the nation’s economy to collapse, be played out in different formats in countries across the globe?

### And we are in the end times

Whether, the grapes of wrath are fast-ripening or not, The Book of Revelations makes it very clear that the end-times will be marked by severe inflation and famine across the globe. 

>*When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!”*

>*When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.*<br>The Book of Revelations, Chapter 6, Verses 5-7

Jesus himself warned in His Olivet Discourse:

>*For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are __but the beginning of the birth pains__.*<br>
 \- Mathew, Chapter 24, Verse 7,8  

With all that is going on all around us, it does seem we are living in the end times and grapes are fast-ripening for:

>*"the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger"* <br>
\-The Book of Revelations, Chapter 14, Verse 10
