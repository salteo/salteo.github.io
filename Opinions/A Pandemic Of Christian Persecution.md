## A Pandemic of Christian Persecution

People across the world are struggling to deal with the effects of widespread lockdowns. However, especially in the rural villages of India, Christians who are often a despised minority have to face an additional battle - that of persecution. This persecution takes different forms, beatings, an ineligibility to receive rations, opposition, and hatred from their communities.  

India is currently ranked no 10. on [Open Doors 2020 World Watch List][Watchlist] of countries where it's most difficult to be a Christian. Below is a round-up of recent articles detailing the persecution our brothers and sisters are enduring.

While our Lord promised persecution to everyone who chooses to follow Him, it is also our bounden duty to remember and pray earnestly for those in such distress. May we persevere, because sooner rather than later in these end times, one day it may be our turn!
