# The Calf and The Rope

Every morning I look out of my high-rise window and see a big black buffalo and its calf being led by a burly man to a grassy field that has so far valiantly survived the onslaught of the concrete jungle. I see the man tying the buffalo to a stake that he has fixed close to a mound of cut-up hay. And as I watch the buffalo happily munching away, the young one freely yet unsteadily totters around her, examining whatever catches its fancy. 

More recently however, as the calf has become older, the farmer occasionally ties the calf to another stake near its mother, perhaps to get it used to the rope. Initially, the calf would strain against the rope yearning to be free. But as the days pass, I see the rope becoming comfortable around that still slender neck, as it begins to define the boundaries for the calf’s movements. And with each passing day, I observe the struggling and the straining diminishing almost imperceptibly. One sad day, I realise that the calf is now living within the boundaries defined for it by that farmer’s cruel rope, having given up that last snort of complaint at the injustice of it all.

Isn't this a picture of ourselves? When we are young and idealistic, we know of no boundaries that can restrict us. But as the years pass, and life puts its ropes around us, we stop straining and struggling, and stretching forward into the unknown. We begin getting comfortable with the boundaries that have been imposed on us. And we uncomplainingly settle down into comfort and complacence.

Every morning I looked out of my window and saw a calf turning into a buffalo. Every morning I look into the mirror and see a young man growing old.

*I wrote this short piece  way back sometime between 2008-2010 for my then employer’s blog community, during my stay in Pune. I recently dug it out of my archives and proceeded to edit it with gusto. But I’m not sure whether the edits did more harm than good. Though I've lost it for ever now, perhaps the original  was much better, not having the burden of the additional cynicism I’ve acquired over the years*
