## While he sleeps

His large head nestles perfectly in the cranny between my shoulders and head. He has a congested throat and as he sleeps he snores softly, so softly that you can hardly hear it unless you’re listening closely. And I am listening closely. His tiny chest presses against mine as it expands and his hair exudes the smell of fresh shampoo into my nose that is pressed into  it. His whole being rests on me and yet I am not burdened Because how heavy really can a one year old be?

And yet as the days have passed he has grown heavier. I remember when I first tried to put him to sleep some months ago. He didn’t like it when I placed his featherweight head on my stomach that rose and fell as I breathed laying down. Perhaps to him it felt like sleeping on the heaving seas. But now he lies content, his now heavier head weighing against my collarbone. At night when he knows it’s time to sleep, he’ll look towards the music system as I put in a CD and then snuggle closer and soon he’s found his spot and his comfy position and he’s fast asleep.

He’s growing fast and soon he’ll be too heavy. Too heavy to throw into the air. To carry around. To place on top of my stomach to sleep. Or even to cradle against my neck. He’s almost walking by himself these days, and somehow while I’m happy for his new steps of independence I mourn the loss of his dependence on me for his comfort and his moments of joy. And mine.

For can there be a sweeter joy than to watch him laugh with abandonment as he is thrown into the air, to watch him  giggling with complete trust, knowing fully well that the very hands that threw him up would be waiting to prevent him from falling? 

He came from nowhere and yet has filled so many lives with delight. Such is the power of a newborn child.
