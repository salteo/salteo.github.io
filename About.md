## About

The Salteo Magazine is a collection of writings by Charlie, a writer based out of Bangalore, India. This project is a break from the mind-numbing effect of his freelancing work, which mostly involves churning out marketing copy for several global corporations.

Here youâ€™ll find articles, essays, stories, poetry, and more, all sprinkled with a little bit of salt. Hope you enjoy these reads!
